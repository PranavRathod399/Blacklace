*Blacklace Project Log*

Took a step back from deep implementation this week to reflect, recalibrate, and learn. While I missed one key opportunity, the process helped clarify the next steps for Blacklace and where I need to level up — especially around hardware integration and long-term team formation.

Most of my time went into understanding the YC process, reviewing past experiments, and trimming unnecessary code in the prototype. Also started mapping out a few variations of the Blackjack-Blacknet interaction flow based on feedback and system constraints.

Though forward motion was quieter, the foundation got stronger. I’ll return to pushing core development next week with a sharper mindset and lighter codebase.
